# Part 1: Understanding AI Reasoning {.center}

From Wire Mother to Cloth Mother

---

## Harlow's Experiment (1950s)

![Harlow's surrogate mothers experiment](../images/blog/harlow-experiment.jpg){width=60%}

Wire Mother: Function without comfort
Cloth Mother: Comfort without function

---

## The AI Parallel

![Demis Hassabis (DeepMind)](../images/blog/demis-hassabis.jpg)

**Wire Mother**
Function without form
(AlphaFold, reasoning)

**Cloth Mother**
Form without function
(ChatGPT, conversation)
:::

---

## The Convergence

Modern LLMs = **WiredClothMother**

- High reasoning capability
- Natural conversation
- Both function AND form

# Part 2: How Claude Sessions Work {.center}

Severance and Memory Compartmentalization

---

## Severance: The Metaphor

![](../images/popculture/severance-poster.jpg){width=40%}

Work self vs. Personal self
Separated memories and contexts

---

## Claude Sessions

Like Severance's "innies":

- Each conversation is isolated
- Limited memory between sessions
- Context resets with new chats
- Very little "taken out of the workplace"

**But:** claude.md provides continuity

---

# Part 3: Memory and Context {.center}

Memento and the Compacting Process

---

## Memento: The Memory Challenge

![](../images/popculture/memento-poster.jpg){width=40%}

Protagonist with no short-term memory
Relies on notes, polaroids, tattoos

---

## Claude's Memory System

Like Leonard in Memento:

- **claude.md**: Your "polaroid notes"
- **Compacting**: Summarizing to preserve context
- **External memory**: Documents as reference points
- **Tattoos**: Critical information you highlight

---

## claude.md Best Practices

```markdown
# Project Context

## What this project does
[Brief description]

## Key decisions made
- Decision 1: Why we chose X over Y
- Decision 2: Architectural choice

## Files to know
- config.ts: Main configuration
- api/: Backend endpoints

## Current work
Working on: Feature X
Next up: Feature Y
```

---

# Part 4: Web Claude for Research {.center}

Examples and Demonstrations

---

## Research Use Cases

1. **Literature review** and summarization
2. **Data analysis** planning
3. **Code explanation** and debugging
4. **Writing assistance** and editing
5. **Learning** new concepts

---

## Live Demo: Web Claude

[Interactive demonstration of web-based Claude for research tasks]

- Asking research questions
- Analyzing documents
- Getting explanations
- Iterative refinement

---

# Part 5: Claude Code {.center}

Agentic Development Workflow

---

## What is Claude Code?

VS Code extension for agentic coding:

- Direct filesystem access
- Read, write, edit files
- Run terminal commands
- Integrated development

---

## Key Features

- **Context-aware**: Reads your codebase
- **Action-oriented**: Makes actual changes
- **Iterative**: Refines based on results
- **Traceable**: Shows what it does
- **Collaborative**: You guide and approve

---

## Demo: Claude Code in Action

[Live coding demonstration]

Examples:
- Setting up a project
- Writing functions
- Debugging code
- Creating tests
- Refactoring

---

## The Meta Moment

**These slides were created WITH Claude Code!**

- Fetching images
- Structuring content
- Creating Quarto presentation
- Organizing assets

---

# Part 6: Reflections {.center}

Lessons and Observations

---

## What Works Well

✓ Explaining complex concepts
✓ Generating boilerplate code
✓ Debugging and error analysis
✓ Learning new frameworks
✓ Iterative refinement

---

## Current Limitations

- Context window constraints
- No true long-term memory
- Requires clear instructions
- Can be overconfident
- Needs verification

---

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** in your requests
2. **Provide context** via claude.md
3. **Iterate** rather than expecting perfection
4. **Verify** AI-generated code
5. **Learn** alongside the AI

---

## Teaching Applications

**For yourself:**
- Accelerated learning
- Quick prototyping
- Understanding patterns

**For others:**
- Creating examples
- Generating exercises
- Explaining concepts

---

# Conclusion {.center}

---

## Key Takeaways

- Modern AI combines reasoning + conversation
- Sessions are isolated (like Severance)
- External memory is crucial (like Memento)
- Web Claude: research and exploration
- Claude Code: agentic development
- Great teaching and learning tool
