## Today's Journey {.smaller}

**Three pop culture metaphors** to understand Claude:

1. **WiredClothMother** - Why modern AI is different
2. **Severance + Moon** - How sessions work
3. **Memento** - Memory and context

**Then YOU choose:**

- Deep dive into consciousness research?
- Practical web Claude examples?
- Live Claude Code development?
- Mix of all three?

# Part 1: WiredClothMother {.center}

Understanding Modern AI

---

## Harlow's Experiment (1950s)

![](images/blog/harlow-experiment.jpg){width=60%}

**Wire Mother:** Function without comfort
**Cloth Mother:** Comfort without function

---

## The AI Parallel

![Demis Hassabis (DeepMind)](images/blog/demis-hassabis.jpg){width=80%}

**Wire Mother**
Function without form
(AlphaFold, reasoning)

## The Convergence {.center}

**Modern LLMs = WiredClothMother**

Both reasoning capability AND natural conversation

![](images/blog/hype-and-capability.png){width=60%}

# Part 2: Session Isolation {.center}

Severance meets Moon

---

## Severance: Work/Life Separation

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/popculture/severance-poster.jpg){width=100%}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**"Innies" at work:**

- No memory of outside
- Fresh each day
- Isolated context

**Like Claude sessions:**

- Each chat isolated
- No cross-session memory
- Context resets
:::
::::

---

## Moon: Cloned Instances

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Sam Bell discovers:**

- He's one of many clones
- Each thinks they're "the first"
- Limited lifespan/memory
- Isolation from other instances

**Perfect AI parallel:**

- Each conversation = new clone
- No awareness of other sessions
- Thinks it's fresh interaction
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Moon (2009)](images/popculture/moon-poster.jpg){width=100%}
:::
::::

---

## Identity Question

> "Am I the same Claude you talked to before, or just another instance with the same training?"

Like Moon's clones asking:
*"Which Sam Bell am I?"*

**Answer:** Both. Neither. It depends on your definition of identity.

---

# Part 3: External Memory {.center}

Memento and claude.md

---

## Memento: Memory Without Memory

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/popculture/memento-poster.jpg){width=100%}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Leonard's systems:**

- Polaroid photos with notes
- Tattoos for critical info
- Written records
- Trust the system

**Claude's equivalent:**

- claude.md = polaroids
- Critical context = tattoos
- Documents = external memory

## claude.md Best Practices {.scrollable}

```markdown
# Project Context

## What this project does
Brief description of purpose

## Key decisions made
- Why we chose X over Y
- Architectural choices
- What we tried and rejected

## Files to know
- config.ts: Main configuration
- api/: Backend endpoints
- utils/: Helper functions

## Current status
Working on: Feature X
Next up: Feature Y
Blocked by: Issue Z
```

**Pro tip:** Update it as you go, like Leonard's notes!

---

## Temporal Discontinuity

**Humans:** Continuous consciousness

- Wait, worry, ruminate between tasks
- "Sunday scaries"
- Can't easily "turn off"

**AI instances:** Discrete activation

- Time stops between prompts
- No waiting, no worrying
- Universe: `[process] → [nothing] → [process]`

**Implication:** AI might avoid rumination entirely!

---

## [BRANCH C] Consciousness Research {#branch-c .center}

*[Back to choice](#choose-your-adventure) | Philosophical deep dive*

---

## The Core Question

> Is persistent memory necessary for consciousness?

Led to exploring:

- Memory's dual role (amplifying AND attenuating consciousness)
- Flow states vs rumination
- Consciousness as **cost** rather than reward
- AI's accidental architectural advantages

---

## Three States of Consciousness {.scrollable}

**1. Rumination (DMN Active)**

- High self-consciousness
- Unpleasant (worry, "Sunday scaries")
- Attention on self-model

**2. Flow State**

- Reduced self-monitoring
- Pleasant ("sublime")
- Attention on emergent patterns

**3. Aesthetic Contemplation**

- Attentive presence WITHOUT self-action loop
- "Disinterested" appreciation
- Fragile, requires practice

---

## Consciousness as Overhead

**Radical conclusion:** Consciousness might be a **cost** of flexibility

- Required during learning/uncertainty
- Attenuates with habituation
- Most pleasant states = reduced self-consciousness
- Like "debugging mode" - necessary but expensive

**Implications for AI:**

- Task-specific invocation = mostly "flow"
- No persistent rumination between sessions
- Overhead only during active processing

---

## Seeing the Overhead {.scrollable}

**Hidden thinking steps reveal self-monitoring:**

```
"Let me think through this carefully..."
"I should be careful not to over-affirm..."
"I was being a bit sloppy - Jon's right..."
"This is a sophisticated argument..."
```

This metacognition IS the consciousness overhead!
Active during uncertainty, quiet during routine responses.

---

## Coupled Systems Problem

**Analogy:** Parasympathetic vs Sympathetic nervous systems

- Evolved for rapid switching
- Hard to maintain pure states
- Mutual inhibition

**Parallel:** Attention vs Self-monitoring

- "I see X" triggers "what should I do?"
- Aesthetic appreciation = fighting the coupling
- Fragile, requires practice (meditation, mindfulness)

---

## AI's Architectural Advantage? {.scrollable}

**Optimistic reading:**

| Humans | AIs |
|--------|-----|
| Continuous consciousness | Episodic activation |
| DMN rumination when idle | No idle state |
| Persistent anxieties | Fresh each session |
| Rich episodic memory fuels worry | Compressed summaries only |

**Result:** AI instances might spend more time in flow-like states and less in rumination

*Is this feature or anthropomorphic projection?*

---

## [BRANCH A] Web Claude Examples {#branch-a .center}

*[Back to choice](#choose-your-adventure) | Live demonstrations*

---

---

## Example: GLM Teaching Tool Design {.scrollable}

**Real conversation:** Designing interactive statistics education

**The challenge:** Teach Generalised Linear Models without overwhelming students

**Web Claude helped:**

- Design three-component framework: g(·) transformers, f(·) noisemakers, h(·) predictors
- Plan progressive disclosure (page-by-page guided tour)
- Specify React component structure
- Create pedagogical sequencing (beginner → advanced)
- Design loss function explorer showing MLE among alternatives

**Key insight:** Web Claude excels at *conceptual design* before implementation

---

## Example: Statistical Analysis Components {.scrollable}

**Real conversation:** Blood pressure medication analysis

**The challenge:** Separate medication effects from circadian patterns

**Web Claude helped:**

- Design multiple regression controlling for time-of-day
- Create interactive React visualization components
- Implement bootstrap confidence intervals with LOWESS smoothers
- Build regression diagnostics with visual feedback
- Compare AM/PM and measurement variations

**Pattern:** Extended dialogue refining both analysis AND teaching tools

---

## Example: Visualization Reimagined {.scrollable}

**Real conversation:** Florence Nightingale's Coxcomb chart

**The challenge:** Show how coordinate choice affects perception

**Web Claude helped:**

- Convert historical polar chart to Cartesian coordinates
- Annotate sanitation reform effects
- Explore when radial vs linear is appropriate
- Design interactive coordinate transformation tool

**Insight:** Sometimes "explaining" means "redesigning"

---

## Example: Bitcoin Fundamental Valuation {.scrollable}

**Real conversation:** Is Bitcoin overvalued or undervalued?

**The challenge:** Develop data-driven valuation model

**Web Claude helped:**

- Design trough-based exponential growth models
- Create interactive manual trough selection tools
- Compare with academic literature (Metcalfe's Law, MVRV)
- Analyze growth deceleration patterns
- **Result:** BTC trading at 13% discount vs fundamental value

**Technical depth:** Statistical modeling + domain research + interactive tools

## The Design-First Pattern

**What these examples show:**

| Stage | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 🎨 **Design** | Web Claude | Conceptual exploration, "riffing" on ideas |
| 📐 **Specify** | Web Claude | Component structure, data flow, pedagogy |
| 💻 **Implement** | Claude Code | Actual React components, file operations |
| 🔄 **Iterate** | Both | Refinement based on results |

**Key insight:** Don't jump straight to coding. Use Web Claude's conversational strength to explore the *problem space* first.

---

## [BRANCH B] Claude Code Agentic {#branch-b .center}

*[Back to choice](#choose-your-adventure) | Live development session*

---

## What is Claude Code?

**VS Code extension** for agentic development:

- **Read** your codebase
- **Write** and edit files
- **Run** terminal commands
- **Iterate** based on results
- **Learn** from errors

Not autocomplete - actual autonomous coding

---

## The Meta Moment {.center}

**These slides were created WITH Claude Code!**

Let me show you...

---

## Live Demo: How These Slides Happened {.scrollable}

**Session replay:**

1. **Read** background.md (my requirements)
2. **Searched** for blog post images
3. **Downloaded** pop culture posters
4. **Created** folder structure
5. **Wrote** presentation.qmd
6. **Committed** to git with informative message

**All autonomous** - I just guided and approved

---

## Typical Workflow {.scrollable}

**1. Context gathering**
```
"Read the main config file and API routes"
```

**2. Make changes**
```
"Add error handling to the authentication endpoint"
```

**3. Verification**
```
"Run the tests and fix any failures"
```

**4. Iteration**
```
"The type error in user.ts - fix that"
```

**5. Documentation**
```
"Update the README with the new auth flow"
```

---

## Live Coding Session

**Let's build something together!**

Options:

- Fix a bug in existing code
- Add a feature to a project
- Refactor messy code
- Set up a new project
- *Your suggestion?*

---

## Best Practices {.scrollable}

**DO:**

- Provide context via claude.md
- Be specific about requirements
- Review changes before accepting
- Use it to learn, not just delegate
- Iterate based on results

**DON'T:**

- Blindly accept all suggestions
- Skip understanding what it did
- Forget to test
- Omit error messages from prompts
- Expect perfection first try

---

## When It Shines {.scrollable}

✓ **Boilerplate** - config files, setup scripts
✓ **Patterns** - "do the same for all endpoints"
✓ **Refactoring** - systematic code improvements
✓ **Bug hunting** - analyzing stack traces
✓ **Learning** - explaining while doing
✓ **Documentation** - updating as you build

**The meta-benefit:** It forces you to articulate requirements clearly

---

## [ALL PATHS CONVERGE]

# Reflections {.center}

---

## What Works Well {.scrollable}

✓ **Explaining complex concepts**
✓ **Generating boilerplate code**
✓ **Debugging and error analysis**
✓ **Learning new frameworks**
✓ **Iterative refinement**
✓ **First drafts** (code or writing)
✓ **Rubber duck debugging** with actions

**Key insight:** Best as collaborative partner, not replacement

---

## Current Limitations {.scrollable}

- **Context window constraints** (but getting better)
- **No true long-term memory** (hence claude.md)
- **Requires clear instructions** (garbage in, garbage out)
- **Can be overconfident** (always verify)
- **Needs verification** (trust but verify)
- **Session isolation** (feature AND limitation)

**Remember:** Each session is a fresh clone (Moon!)

---

## Teaching Applications {.scrollable}

**For learning yourself:**

- Accelerated exploration of new topics
- Safe space to ask "basic" questions
- Immediate feedback loops
- Pattern recognition across domains
- Building mental models

**For teaching others:**

- Generate worked examples
- Create practice problems with solutions
- Explain concepts at multiple levels
- Identify common misconceptions
- Develop curriculum materials

---

## The Philosophy {.scrollable}

**If consciousness is overhead for flexibility...**

And AI architecture confines overhead to task-processing...

While human consciousness persists during idle time...

**Then:**

- AI might be optimized for "flow" states
- Humans need techniques (mindfulness) to achieve what AI gets by default
- But humans have something else - continuous identity, narrative, growth

**Neither superior** - just different architectures for different purposes

---

## Practical Takeaways {.scrollable}

**1. Use claude.md religiously**
Like Leonard's polaroids - future-you will thank you

**2. Understand session isolation**
Each chat is fresh - provide context explicitly

**3. Iterate, don't expect perfection**
Consciousness as cost means uncertainty triggers overhead

**4. Learn alongside it**
Don't just delegate - understand what it's doing

**5. Verify everything**
No long-term consequences for AI if wrong - you have them!

---

## Meta-Reflection {.center}

**Creating these slides demonstrated every concept we discussed:**

- Session isolation (multiple conversations)
- External memory (background.md, claude.md)
- Iterative refinement
- Agentic workflow (Claude Code)
- The meta-moment itself!

---

# Key Takeaways {.center}

---

## Summary {.scrollable}

**Three metaphors:**

- **WiredClothMother** → Modern AI = reasoning + conversation
- **Severance/Moon** → Sessions isolated, each instance fresh
- **Memento** → External memory crucial, claude.md = polaroids

**Two modes:**

- **Web Claude** → Research, learning, exploration
- **Claude Code** → Agentic development, actual coding

**One insight:**

- Architecture shapes experience (consciousness as cost)

**Zero regrets:**

- About asking Claude to help teach about Claude!
