# Web Claude Research Examples for Tech Talk

This file contains illustrative examples of research conducted with web Claude (not Claude Code), organised by research category. These examples demonstrate different use cases for the web interface.

**GitHub repo (inferred):** `https://github.com/JonMinton/jon-tech-talk`
**Presentation file (likely):** `presentation.qmd` or similar at root

## SUGGESTED PLACEMENT

This material should replace or augment the **[BRANCH A] Web Claude Examples** section (around slides 23-27 in the existing presentation). The current section has placeholder "Live demonstration" content that can be replaced with these concrete examples.

Specifically, integrate after the slide titled "Research Use Cases" and before/instead of the "Demo 1: Analyzing Research" placeholder.

## What These Examples Demonstrate

| Use Case | Key Capability |
|----------|----------------|
| Quantitative finance | Iterative model development, literature search |
| Medical statistics | Regression analysis, confounding control |
| Philosophy | Extended conceptual exploration |
| Policy analysis | Systematic literature review, bibliography |
| Cultural criticism | Cross-referencing sources, synthesis |
| Financial planning | Code generation, tax rule verification |

## Common Patterns

1. **Iterative refinement** - Start broad, narrow progressively
2. **Citation trails** - Request and verify sources
3. **Code generation** - Get reusable scripts with explanation
4. **Synthesis** - Connect ideas across domains
5. **Extended dialogue** - Build understanding over multiple turns
6. **Conceptual design** - "Riff" on ideas before implementation
```

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE

1. **Locate the presentation file** - likely `presentation.qmd` in the repo root

2. **Find the Branch A section** - search for `## [BRANCH A] Web Claude Examples` or `{#branch-a}`

3. **Replace the placeholder content** - the current slides have "Live demonstration" placeholders that should be replaced with the concrete examples above

4. **Preserve the navigation structure** - keep the `*[Back to choice](#/choose-your-adventure)*` links

5. **Consider adding a new slide** before the current "Demo 1: Analyzing Research" that introduces the real examples

6. **The QMD links** will render as clickable hyperlinks when the Quarto presentation is built

## ADDITIONAL SECTION: PEDAGOGIC TOOLS FOR STATISTICS

This section covers conversations where we collaboratively designed interactive teaching tools for statistical concepts. These demonstrate web Claude's strength in conceptual development before implementation.

### QMD CONTENT FOR PEDAGOGIC TOOLS

```markdown
## Pedagogic Tool Development {#pedagogic-tools}

*Designing interactive teaching tools for statistical concepts*

### Generalised Linear Models Interactive Storyboard

**Comprehensive tool design** for teaching GLMs through progressive disclosure:

- Three-component framework: Response transformers g(·), Noisemakers f(·), Predictor transformers h(·)
- Page-by-page guided tour preventing cognitive overload
- Loss function explorer showing MLE as principled choice among alternatives
- Optimisation visualisation with contour plots and trajectory animation
- Distinction between Y (modelled) and y (observed)

Key pedagogical elements:
- Scenario selection cards (hospital readmissions, insurance claims, etc.)
- Interactive coefficient sliders with real-time model updating
- Loss function selector (MLE, least squares, Huber, etc.)
- Algorithm comparison (IRLS, Newton-Raphson, gradient descent)
- Diagnostic dashboard with residual plots

## What Pedagogic Tool Development Demonstrates

| Aspect | Web Claude Strength |
|--------|---------------------|
| Conceptual design | Extended "riffing" dialogue refines ideas |
| Progressive disclosure | Planning page-by-page user journeys |
| Technical specification | React component structure, API design |
| Pedagogical sequencing | Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced modes |
| Visual communication | Describing interactive visualisations before building |

These conversations show web Claude as an ideal collaborator for the *design phase* of educational tools, with Claude Code then handling implementation.

## NOTES

- All links are to actual past conversations and should work if the user is logged in
- The examples span technical (statistics, finance) and humanistic (philosophy, film) domains
- Several conversations demonstrate the handoff between web Claude and Claude Code
- The consciousness conversation directly relates to the existing Branch C content about consciousness research
- The pedagogic tools section demonstrates the design-before-implementation workflow where web Claude excels at conceptual development
