Hello AI agent! 

I am going to be giving a talk on using Claude AI for research and development. The bulk of this talk will concentrate on some examples of using claude both in a web-based capacity, and claude code within vscode. But it would be good to have some intro slides too. 

I would like the slides to be using quarto, likely reveal.js format. 

I have some materials on my blog that I think would be a starting point. This will contain some figures as well as an index.qmd file in a folder with the url name. 

The blog post is here:

And the github repo is here:

There are assets and ideas I'd like to use to explain how Claude Code works from pop culture. These include:

The TV series Severence

The film Her (Less so)

The film Memento

Please look for public assets and title images relating to these and consider where images might be placed in the slides and this folder structure. 

I would be keen to discuss the arguments and order with you frequently. 


Please also look on meetup for Edinburgh based Tech Talks to see if you can find the name and details of the meetup at which I will be giving the talk. (My name is Jon Minton). 

Let's see how this progresses. (It might be quite meta as I can use the production of the slides themselves to illustrate what the slides are about!)
